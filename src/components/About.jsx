              <p>Hi, thank you for visiting.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>I enjoy writing code and have been developing software for several years with over 700+ contributions to open source code on GitHub. 
                Iâ€™ve done research, taken on leadership roles, participated in coding workshops and developed award winning websites and apps in hackathons. 
                I am adaptive and flexible with learning programming languages, frameworks, tech stacks and new technologies. 
                I enjoy the software development process, finding solutions to challenging problems and collaborating with teams to improve software applications.</p>
